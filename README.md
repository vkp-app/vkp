# Virtual Kubernetes Platform

The Virtual Kubernetes Platform (VKP) is a project that provides Kubernetes-as-a-Service by taking advantage of the ClusterAPI and VCluster.
It provides a single pane of glass and at-a-glance information that allows users to focus on developing applications rather than managing Kubernetes clusters.

This project is in progress and is not currently production-ready.
